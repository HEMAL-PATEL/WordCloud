# WordCloud
WordCloud stacks pieces of text in a way that they occupy minimum space while not colliding with eachother.

WordCloud is very customizable and easy to use. The Placing algorithm behaviour can be modified easily through `RotationProvider` and `SpiralProvider` methods.

Check sample code to learn how to use it with default configuration.

## Usage

Add the dependency:
```Groovy
dependencies {
	compile 'com.yashoid:wordcloud:1.0.0'
}
```
